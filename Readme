GSEF - A Generic System Emulator Frontend
v0.01 Alpha

This project exists for the purpose of taking the pressure of UI development away from the emulator core developers, allowing all emulators to be run as plugins through a single, familiar interface. The project is currently only released in an alpha stage and is far from finished.

Dependencies:
	Python 2.7 (http://www.python.org/download/)
	Linux OS (Will be ported to windows and mac after first release)
	Pyglet (http://www.pyglet.org/download.html)
	PyMouse (https://github.com/pepijndevos/PyMouse)
	Gtk3 with GObject Introspection (http://www.gtk.org/download/index.php)
	Pygame (http://www.pygame.org/news.html)
	PyOpenGL (http://pyopengl.sourceforge.net/)
	Cython and GCC (To compile the xordiff module)
	PyAudio (http://people.csail.mit.edu/hubert/pyaudio/)
	Numpy (http://numpy.scipy.org/)

How to:
	After installing all dependencies, navigate to src/xordiff/Cython and run the command:
	"python setup.py build_ext --inplace", no quotes, replace "python" with the name of your Python 2.7 executable.
	Move the resulting "_xordiff.so" file up one directory, to src/xordiff
	Start the program with the command "python src/Main.py", again replacing "python" with your 2.7 executable
	Download some systems and cores. I have included some systems and cores under Systems. Install the system following the below instructions, and do the same with the relevant cores.
	Install your games, then run them (described below)


Install a system:
	Get the archive for the system you want to install *Do not unpack it*.
	In the program, choose "Install System" in the "System" dropdown menu. Assuming it worked correctly, a popup window will tell you your system was installed correctly, or else it will give an error

Install a core:
	Identical to installing a system, except choose "Install Core" from the dropdown menu instead"

Make a game or program:
	Get your main program file (If it's a number of files, compress them all into a single archive, the core will know what to do with them)
	In the program, under the "Game" dropdown menu, choose the "Make Game" option
	Type in a game name, choose a system, and choose a core to use. Use the button to choose your game file, a file navigator will appear.
	Choose "Make Game". A popup will tell you if it was installed or if there were any errors.

Play a game:
	Counter intuitively, the play game button doesn't let you play a game. Instead, choose "Manage Games" and the "Game" menu
	Navigate to the system you want in the tree view 
	Select the game you want then press the "Play Game" button, or double click the game you want
